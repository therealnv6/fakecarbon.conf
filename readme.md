# installation

you can invoke the installation script using the following command:

```sh
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealnv6/fakecarbon.conf/main/install.sh)
```

upon executing this command, you'll be prompted with the following question:

```
Enter the path where you want to save the theme (default:
${HOME}/.config/kitty/):
```

this should generally be kept the default value; unless you're using a more
advanced kitty configuration. in that case, you should know what to change it
to.
